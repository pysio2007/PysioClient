# mcp1.8.9op
A fixed mcp workspace configured for 1.8.9 integrated with optifine and setup with a single `setup.bat`.

## Setup

### Run `setup.bat`
What this will do:
1. Decompile minecraft, which will fail at recompiling.
2. Fix a source bug where a variable name is incorrectly written.
3. Recompile minecraft correctly.
4. Remove minecraft's source code and replace it with optifine's.

What you get at the end:
- A (hopefully) bugless mcp 1.8.9 workspace with optifine pre-installed.
